   <div class="row"><div class="col-8">
      <h5 style="text-align:justify;font-size:17px;">Mytel was granted a telecommunications license on 12 January 2017. The company is operated as a joint venture, 49% owned by Viettel, which is controlled by the Vietnamese military, 28% owned by Star High Public Company, which is owned by the Burmese military's Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), and the remaining 23% owned by Myanmar National Telecom Holding Public Co Ltd, a consortium of local companies. Mytel uses telecoms infrastructure owned by MECtel, a separate operator controlled by MEC. The first call made on
          the network was between Myanmar's Commander-in-Chief, Min Aung Hlaing, and Vietnam's Minister of Defence, Ngo Xuan Lich.
          Mytel is the 4th network operator in Myanmar.</h5>
          </h5> <h5 style="text-align:justify;font-size:17px;">We are the joint venture company which consist of government-owned Star High Public Co Ltd, Myanmar consortium (comprising of 11 companies) MTNH and the Vietnamese telecom company – Viettel.
          Who owns Mytel company?
          The company is operated as a joint venture, 49% owned by Viettel, which is controlled by the Vietnamese military, 28% owned by Star High Public Company, which is owned by the Burmese military's Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), and the remaining 23% owned by Myanmar National Telecom Holding Public Co Ltd.
          In December 2020, Justice for Myanmar released a major investigation detailing a “web of cronyism and corruption” surrounding Mytel.The report also noted the Burmese military's ability to harvest personal data from Mytel users for mass surveillance purposes.[17] The report prompted additional scrutiny into $60 million in loans provided by British banks HSBC and Standard Chartered to Viettel in connection with Mytel.</h5>

  <h2 style="font-weight:bold;">Controversies</h2>
  <h6 style="text-align:justify;">Mytel has been criticized for undermining the competitiveness of Myanmar's telecoms market and the military's reassertion of dominance over telecommunications, through its large-scale investments.[1] In June 2017, the government promulgated the Pricing and Tariff Regulatory Framework, including floor pricing rules for mobile fees, which was positioned to give Mytel a market advantage against lower-cost competitors like Ooredoo.[4] Mytel was granted an exemption from floor pricing rules and was allowed to discount its rates after its launch, unlike other competitors.[1] Through its aggressive price-cutting strategy, Mytel was able to capture a market share of 4% (2.4 million subscribers) only two months after its launch.[5] By contrast, Mytel's competitors agreed to abide by the nominal rules of the free market.</h6>
  <h6 style="text-align:justify;">Mytel has received mixed reactions from Burmese consumers due to its military links. After its launch, a movement of Burmese netizens launched a viral campaign to boycott the military-backed carrier, over its decision to offer phone numbers that start with the digits 969, which are symbolic of Myanmar's anti-Muslim nationalist movement.</h6>
  <h6 style="text-align:justify;">In 2018, reports emerged that Mytel had run fiber-optic cables through privately owned plantations in Kayin State's Payathonzu without providing prior notice.[6] Mytel has upgraded the Myanmar military's infrastructure, including the army's network of fibre-optic cables.</h6>
